# NewUHC

A UHC plugin for papermc servers on Minecraft version 1.19.3

Made for the annual @ComputerScienceHouse Minecraft Charity Stream 
>https://minecraftstream.csh.rit.edu

The goal with this project is to make a UHC plugin that is customizable in as many aspects as possible. Additionally, since UHC is mostly played in older
versions of Minecraft. This plugin is open source and free to use by anyone, meaning anyone can use this plugin on their own server.
